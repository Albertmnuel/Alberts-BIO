      <h3>Why They Call Me Fresh</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I code clean, and I dress clean.</li>
        <li>I bring energy to class, tech events, and everywhere I go.</li>
        <li>I'm confident, creative, and always ready to help others grow.</li>

      <h3>More Than Just Style</h3>
 <p>Aside from being fresh, I'm serious about tech. I build websites, solve real problems, and aim to become a top-tier software engineer. I believe in working smart, staying humble, and standing out for the right reasons.</p>
